## Reflection

This was a 5 hours long project built during my technical test for the Front-End Developer position. Project goals development of a single page using react javascript, styled components and vanilla CSS. The design of the page is so basic.  

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, and then other libraries needed.  


Because i needed to deliver the project i didn't concentrate on the UI so there a basic css. I will considered improving the UI is a future feature that can be added.


At the end of the project, the technologies implemented was `javascript`, `React`, `styled components`, and `CSS`. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
